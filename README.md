## Description
This application allows a user to enter input to define the letter case, whether or not to include a number and/or a symbol, and the number of words to use when generating a password. With this information, the application then parses words from a website and randomly chooses which words to use for the password. The application then provides the user with the password based on the user input and the random words chosen.
